# Pocket Pal 🐾

*A lightweight virtual desktop pet for Windows 11.*

Pocket Pal is a sprite-based desktop companion that lives along the bottom of your screen. It wanders around, idles, runs, sleeps, and reacts naturally while staying out of your way.

The goal of this project is to create a clean, modular foundation that can grow into a fully featured virtual pet with additional behaviors, customization, and mod support.

## 🐶 Pet States

The pet is controlled using a simple state machine.

- Walking
- Running
- Sleeping
- Jumping
- Falling

Only one state is active at any time, making the system easy to maintain and extend.

## 🚶 Movement

Pocket Pal can:

- Walk across the bottom of the screen
- Run occasionally
- Stop to idle
- Turn around at screen edges
- Jump using simple gravity
- Choose actions randomly

Movement is smooth while animations remain locked to **8 FPS**.
